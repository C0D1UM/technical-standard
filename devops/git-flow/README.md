# Git Flow

In this standard, we suggest you multiple implementations of Git Flow. Each flow is different. Some is better when you're developing, some is better when your project was already go live. This standard will help you pick the right one for your project.

Before we start, one thing that's constant is we will use only _one branch_ as a standard.
